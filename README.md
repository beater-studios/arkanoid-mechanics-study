# Arkanoid Mechanics Study

## Overview
This project is a prototype created in GameMaker in August 2021 to study the mechanics of Arkanoid, specifically focusing on ball movement and paddle rebounding. The aim was to experiment with and understand how the ball physics and interactions work in a classic arcade-style game. This project serves as a foundational study for future arcade-style game development.

## Features
- **Ball Movement:** Implemented ball movement using test scripts for various behaviors.
- **Paddle Control:** Basic paddle movement for controlling the ball's trajectory.
- **Rebound Mechanics:** Initial implementation of ball rebound mechanics when hitting the paddle or walls.
